# Machine Learning for Reservoir Characterization

This project leverages machine learning to enhance reservoir characterization in the oil and gas industry.  

## Goal

By analyzing seismic data, well logs, and production data, we aim to build models that:
- Improve prediction of reservoir properties (porosity, permeability, fluid saturation).
- Optimize drilling operations and production processes.
- Enhance safety by detecting anomalies and potential risks.

## Dataset

We use data from the Hugoton and Panoma gas fields, featuring wireline log measurements, indicator variables, and facies labels.

## Machine Learning Techniques

We explore various techniques including:
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** For seismic data interpretation.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVMs):** For rock type classification.
- **Random Forest Regression:** For predicting reservoir properties.
- **Clustering:** For fluid identification.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** For geological facies analysis.

## Conclusion

Machine learning offers valuable tools for understanding and predicting reservoir behavior, leading to optimized exploration and production strategies in the oil and gas industry.
